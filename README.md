# Overview of GoldMineGuide project

#Aim of the project

In addition to the hosting of our mining website and the many solutions that it offers on a cloud 
network rather than a single on-premises or remote server, the purpose of this system is to 
increase the number of businesses that utilize cloud technology. Finally, we want to make sure 
that our company only pays for the resources that it uses while also automating and controlling 
our solutions through the utilization of application programming interfaces (APIs) and other 
services.

#Objectives 

• To develop a scalable and user-friendly AWS-hosted web app tailored to the mining 
sector.
• To show that less time is needed to do the same task as traditional way.
• To establish an online hub for team members and upper management to share 
information and track progress on projects in real time.
• To analyze cloud application throughput via Amazon Web Services' X-Ray service. 
• To develop a website that is capable of adjusting its levels of service in accordance with 
the peak session needs.

#User Roles 

Manager:

The administrator account will continue to serve as the primary login. In order to view the staff 
miner accounts, manager must log in with this account. A user with administrative privileges 
can view staff data and receiving confirmation massage from staff. The real reason for this is 
to solve the issues that happened during covid-19 between staffs and manager. However, as a 
result this project will have the ability to communicate by using AWS SNS service. 

Staff:

All features, including adding and deleting staff accounts, will be available to staff accounts. 
They may control their own personal profile. Miners can be assigned to the specialized mining 
facility by the administrative staff. However, the administration has complete control over 
when mining sites are added or removed. The miner's report on the site's current status will be 
visible to staff accounts as well. In addition, the staff have the ability to edit, create and delete 
gold mining details.
